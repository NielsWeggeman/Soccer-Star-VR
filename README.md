# Soccer-Star-VR

Fit VR Game built for Senior Challenge

*---- Difference between now and previous assignment ----*

Building this game I decided to try and write more of the code myself,
instead of leaning on tutorials. 95% of the code in this game was written
myself, borrowing only small tricks from some tutorials and articles.

This makes the code slightly messy and inefficient, although I tried to clean
it up as much as I could. Next time I would draw up a logic flowchart of the
game before building.

I'm proud in particular of the algorithm that determines how to launch the
ball so that it always lands close to the player (can be seen in the kickBall.cs
file), as well as of figuring out the level system and UI set up all by myself.

In particular, this challenge helped me learn more about:
- Structuring & debugging code
- Setting up different levels in a game
- Working with the unity UI system
- Setting up play-once audiosources
- Working with the particle system
- Working with lighting & flares

In the future, it could be useful for me to learn more about:
- Building more intuitive UI and control experiences
- Creating good instructional experiences
- Working with human avatars for instructions
- Setting up multiplayer interactions in VR
- Creating more realistic materials & lighting in VR
- Spawning and destroying gameObjects
- Optimising design and code to minimise computational load


*---- Welcome to... Soccer Star VR! ----*

This VR Soccer game was built for the SyncVR senior challenge, to showcase
my experience in Unity thusfar. It is a fun and increasingly difficult game
that invites players to work-out in a playful setting.

The challenge was to build an application that lets people exercise by
stretching out their arms and by avoiding objects. After having played several
apps that include this concept, I felt that it would likely be more rewarding
for players to do these kind of exercises in a more gamelike experience.
Therefore I decided to create a Wii Sports like game that invites the player
to move, instead of doing dry exercises.

Soccer Star VR puts you in a professional soccer stadium where you have to
stop the soccer balls and dodge the bombs. The challenge exists out several
levels, where the balls get shot under more and more difficult angles, with
higher speed and with more spin.

N.B. !! The game is designed to be played on Oculus Quest 2!!

You can watch a video recording of the game on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn5rcXA3vUY&ab_channel=NielsWeggeman

*---- N.B. Launch Instructions ----*

Download the 'Soccer Star VR.apk' and install it on Quest 2 to play the game.


*----Further improvements---- *

This app was built within two days time. If I would spend more time on this
game, I would recommend:

- Adding more levels to the game.
- Adding more Soccer Ball models to the game.

I used free assets audio samples to give the game an entertaining, gamelike vibe.
